It''s used for things which are impossible or very unlikely. <ul> <li>I wish that I had a big house (I don''t have a big house, but it''s a nice idea!).</li> <li>I wish that we didn''t need to work today (we do need to work today, unfortunately).</li> <li>I wish that you lived close by (you don''t live close by).</li> <li>I wish that John wasn''t busy tomorrow* (he is busy, unfortunately).</li> </ul> (*In formal writing, you will see ''were'' instead of ''was'' after wish. This is correct, but it''s also fine to use ''was'', in the same way as with the second conditional. <ul><li>''I wish I were rich'' or ''I wish I was rich''.)</li></ul> We also use ''wish'' with ''could'' to talk about things in the present or future that we would like to be different. In this situation, ''could'' is the past simple of ''can''. <br/><br/> Of course, we use ''can'' to talk about ability - if we know how to do something or not. For example, ''I can speak Spanish'' or ''I can''t drive''. We also use ''can'' to talk about possibility - if things are possible or not possible. For example, ''we can''t come to the party tonight'' or ''John can help you clean up''. We use ''could'' with ''wish'' to talk about ability and to talk about possibility. <ul> <li>I wish that I could speak Spanish (but, unfortunately, I can''t speak Spanish).</li> <li>I wish that I could drive (I can''t drive).</li> <li>I wish that we could go to the party tonight (unfortunately, we''re busy so we can''t go).</li> <li>I wish that John could help you clean up (John is at work, so he can''t help).</li> </ul> We don''t usually use ''wish'' in this way for things that are really possible in the future. Instead, we use ''hope''. <ul> <li>I hope that you pass your exam (NOT: <del>I wish that you passed the exam</del>).</li> <li>I hope that it''s sunny tomorrow (NOT: <del>I wish that it was sunny tomorrow</del>).</li> <li>I hope that Julie has a lovely holiday (NOT: <del>I wish that Julie had a lovely holiday</del>).</li> </ul> <strong>Wish + (that) + would:</strong> <br/>On the other hand, we use ''would'' with ''wish'' in a little bit of a special way. It''s generally used about other people who are doing (or not doing) something that we don''t like and we want that person to change. It''s not usually used about ourselves, or about something which nobody can change though, exceptionally, we do use it about the weather. <ul><li>I wish that John wouldn''t eat all the chocolate. (John does usually eat all the chocolate and I don''t like it. I want him to change his behaviour!)</li> <li>I wish that the neighbours would be quiet! (They are not quiet and I don''t like the noise.)</li> <li>I wish that you wouldn''t smoke so much! (You do smoke a lot and I don''t like it. I want you to change this.)</li> <li>I wish that you wouldn''t work late so often.</li> <li>I wish that it would stop raining!</li> </ul> We don''t usually use ''would'' when there''s no feeling that we want somebody to change their behaviour. <ul><li>NOT: <del>I wish that tomorrow would be a holiday.</del> (Instead: I wish that tomorrow was a holiday.)</li> <li>NOT: <del>I wish that I would work harder.</del> (It''s strange to use ''wish'' + ''would'' about yourself, as you can change your behaviour if you don''t like it!)</li> </ul> <h3>Wishes about the past</h3> <strong>Wish + (that) + past perfect:</strong> <br/>We can use ''wish'' with the past perfect to talk about regrets from the past. These are things that have already happened but we wish they''d happened in a different way. This use of ''wish'' is very similar to the <a href="http://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/third-conditional.html" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">third conditional</a>. <ul> <li>I wish that I had studied harder at school. (I didn''t study hard at school, and now I''m sorry about it.)</li> <li>I wish that I hadn''t eaten so much yesterday! (But I did eat a lot yesterday. Now I think it wasn''t a good idea.)</li> <li>I wish that the train had been on time. (But unfortunately the train was late, and so I missed my interview.)</li> </ul> <h3>Other uses of ''wish''</h3> <strong>Wish + to + infinitive:</strong> <br/>We can use ''wish'' with the infinitive to mean ''would like''. This is very formal. We don''t usually use a continuous tense with ''wish'' in this case. <ul> <li>I wish to speak to the headmaster. (This means the same as ''I would like to speak to the headmaster''.)</li> <li>I wish to go now.</li> </ul> <strong>Wish + object + to + infinitive:</strong> <br/>In the same way, we can use ''wish'' with an object and an infinitive. <ul> <li>I do not wish you to publish this article.</li> <li>I wish these people to leave.</li> </ul> <strong>Wish + somebody + something:</strong> <br/>This is used mostly in set phrases. <ul> <li>I wished him a happy birthday.</li> <li>They wished us Merry Christmas.</li> </ul>');

Inversion just means putting the verb before the subject. We usually do it in question forms: <ul><li>Normal sentence: You are tired. (The subject is ''you''. It''s before the verb ''are''.)</li> <li>Question form: Are you tired? (The verb ''are'' is before the subject ''you''. They have changed places. This is called inversion.)</li></ul> In most English verb tenses, when we want to use inversion, we just move the verb to before the subject. If there''s more than one verb, because a verb tense has auxiliary verbs for example, we move the first verb.<br/><br/> With two verb tenses where we just change the places of the verb and subject: <ul><li>Present simple with ''be'': am I / are you / is he</li> <li>Past simple with ''be'': were you / was she</li></ul> With other verbs tenses, we change the place of the subject and the auxiliary verb (the first auxiliary verb if there is more than one). We don''t move the other parts of the verb: <ul><li>Present continuous: am I going / are you going</li> <li>Past continuous: was he going / were they going</li> <li>Present perfect: have we gone / has she gone</li> <li>Present perfect continuous: has she been going / have they been going</li> <li>Past perfect: had you gone</li> <li>Past perfect continuous: had he been going</li> <li>Future simple: will they go</li> <li>Future continuous: will you be going</li> <li>Future perfect: will they have gone</li> <li>Future perfect continuous: will she have been going</li> <li>Modal verbs: should I go / would you go</li></ul> There are two tenses where we need to add ''do / does / did'' to make the question form. We also need to change the main verb back to the infinitive. This is usually still called inversion. <ul><li>Present simple with any verb except ''be'' (add ''do'' or ''does''): do you go / does he go</li> <li>Past simple with any verb except ''be'' (add ''did''): did we go / did they go</li></ul> <strong>When do we use inversion?</strong> Of course, we use inversion in questions. But we also sometimes use inversion in other cases, when we are not making a question.<br/><br/> <strong>1: When we use a negative adverb or adverb phrase at the beginning of the sentence.</strong><br/><br/> Usually, we put the expression at the beginning of the sentence to emphasise what we''re saying. It makes our sentence sound surprising or striking or unusual. It also sounds quite formal. If you don''t want to give this impression, you can put the negative expression later in the sentence in the normal way: <ul><li>Seldom have I seen such beautiful work.<br/> (''Seldom'' is at the beginning, so we use inversion. This sentence emphasizes what beautiful work it is.)</li> <li>I have seldom seen such beautiful work.<br/> (''Seldom'' is in the normal place, so we don''t use inversion. This is a normal sentence with no special emphasis.)</li></ul> Here are some negative adverbs and adverb phrases that we often use with inversion: <table border="1" style="width:100%"> <tr><td>Hardly</td><td>Hardly had I got into bed when the telephone rang.</td></tr> <tr><td>Never</td><td>Never had she seen such a beautiful sight before.</td></tr> <tr><td>Seldom</td><td>Seldom do we see such an amazing display of dance.</td></tr> <tr><td>Rarely</td><td>Rarely will you hear such beautiful music.</td></tr> <tr><td>Only then</td><td>Only then did I understand why the tragedy had happened.</td></tr> <tr><td>Not only ... but</td><td>Not only does he love chocolate and sweets but he also smokes.</td></tr> <tr><td>No sooner</td><td>No sooner had we arrived home than the police rang the doorbell.</td></tr> <tr><td>Scarcely</td><td>Scarcely had I got off the bus when it crashed into the back of a car.</td></tr> <tr><td>Only later</td><td>Only later did she really think about the situation.</td></tr> <tr><td>Nowhere</td><td>Nowhere have I ever had such bad service.</td></tr> <tr><td>Little</td><td>Little did he know!</td></tr> <tr><td>Only in this way</td><td>Only in this way could John earn enough money to survive.</td></tr> <tr><td>In no way</td><td>In no way do I agree with what you''re saying.</td></tr> <tr><td>On no account</td><td>On no account should you do anything without asking me first.</td></tr> </table> In the following expressions, the inversion comes in the second part of the sentence: <table> <tr><td>Not until</td><td>Not until I saw John with my own eyes did I really believe he was safe.</td></tr> <tr><td>Not since</td><td>Not since Lucy left college had she had such a wonderful time.</td></tr> <tr><td>Only after</td><td>Only after I''d seen her flat did I understand why she wanted to live there.</td></tr> <tr><td>Only when</td><td>Only when we''d all arrived home did I feel calm.</td></tr> <tr><td>Only by</td><td>Only by working extremely hard could we afford to eat.</td></tr> </table> We only use inversion when the adverb modifies the whole phrase and not when it modifies the noun: Hardly anyone passed the exam. (No inversion.)<br/><br/> <strong>2: We can use inversion instead of ''if'' in conditionals with ''had'' ''were'' and ''should''. This is quite formal:</strong> <ul><li>Normal conditional: If I had been there, this problem wouldn''t have happened.</li> <li>Conditional with inversion: Had I been there, this problem wouldn''t have happened.</li></ul> <ul><li>Normal conditional: If we had arrived sooner, we could have prevented this tragedy!</li> <li>Conditional with inversion: Had we arrived sooner, we could have prevented this tragedy!</li></ul> <strong>3: We can use inversion if we put an adverbial expression of place at the beginning on the sentence. This is also quite formal or literary:</strong> <ul><li>On the table was all the money we had lost. (Normal sentence: All the money we had lost was on the table.)</li> <li>Round the corner came the knights. (Normal sentence: The knights came round the corner.)</li></ul> <strong>4: We can use inversion after ''so + adjective...that'':</strong> <ul><li>So beautiful was the girl that nobody could talk of anything else. (Normal sentence: the girl was so beautiful that nobody could talk of anything else.)</li> <li>So delicious was the food that we ate every last bite.

It means that the subject caused the action to happen, but didn''t do it themselves. Maybe they paid, or asked, or persuaded the other person to do it. For example, we can say: <ul><li>I cleaned my house. (This means I cleaned it myself).</li></ul> If I paid someone to clean it, of course I can say: <ul><li>A cleaner cleaned my house.</li></ul> But, another way is to use a causative construction. So I can also say: <ul><li>I had my house cleaned.</li></ul> In a sense, using a causative verb is similar to using a passive. The important thing is that the house is now clean. We don''t focus on who did the cleaning.<br/><br> <strong>Have + object + past participle (have something done)</strong><br/><br/> We usually use ''have something done'' when we are talking about paying someone to do something for us. It''s often used for services. The form is ''subject + have + object + past participle''. <ul><li>I had my car washed.</li> <li>John will have his house painted.</li></ul> <strong>Get + object + past participle (get something done)</strong><br/><br/> We can also use ''subject + get + object + past participle''.

This has a very similar meaning to ''have something done'', which we''ve already talked about, but this time we say who did the thing - we talk about the person who we asked to do the thing for us. <ul><li>I had the electrician look at my broken light.</li> <li>The doctor will have the nurse call the patients.</li> <li>The teacher had the students write the answers on the whiteboard.</li></ul> <strong>Get someone to do something (get + person + to + infinitive)</strong><br/><br/> Finally, we can also use the construction ''get + someone + to + infinitive''. Again, this means that you cause the other person to do the action, maybe by paying them to do it, or by asking them to do it, or by persuading them to do it. <ul><li>She gets her son to do his homework by promising him ice cream when he''s finished.</li> <li>I got the cleaner to clean under the cupboards.</li></ul> Sometimes, this construction has the feeling that we needed to convince someone to do something, while the other constructions on this page are neutral.<br/><br>);

I think my parents would have gone mad if I’d suggested not going, but fortunately I wanted to go!</p>  <p>One of the top universities in the UK, Royal Holloway, is quite expensive. However, I did manage financially without support from my parents as I received considerable support from the government. The third year was the most difficult financially, and I spent very little time going out with my friends. I think I spent too much on food; I did not want to eat only beans and noodles – usual food for a student. I had a proper oven and stove to cook good meals. I also needed to buy more books, though fortunately as my brother had been at Royal Holloway and had studied similar subjects, I was able to use his books.</p>  <p>To be admitted to Royal Holloway I needed high marks. I worked hard to get them and I succeeded. At first, I thought that university seems like a big challenge. I was not really sure how to write university essays, but soon got used to it. I think the most important thing in the first year is to develop the skills needed for the second and third years. I did not find it hard moving away from home. I was looking forward to being independent. After finishing university I moved back home and that was difficult to get used to! I was fortunate enough to have many friends in my first year, and, though I met new people in both my second and third years, a number of those from the first year are still my closest friends today.</p>  <p>I believe I made the right choice when I chose History. On the one hand, History was one of my favourite subjects. On the other hand, after finishing the Faculty of History, the doors are open to many different careers.

It could be described as a form of artificial or &quot;heightened&quot; documentary. Although the genre has existed in some form or another since the early years of television, the current explosion of popularity dates from around 2000.<br/><br/>Reality television covers a wide range of television programming formats, from game or quiz shows which resemble the frantic, often demeaning programmes produced in Japan in the 1980s and 1990s (a modern example is Gaki no tsukai), to surveillance- or voyeurism- focused productions such as Big Brother.<br/><br/>Critics say that the term &quot;reality television&quot; is somewhat of a misnomer and that such shows frequently portray a modified and highly influenced form of reality, with participants put in exotic locations or abnormal situations, sometimes coached to act in certain ways by off-screen handlers, and with events on screen manipulated through editing and other post-production techniques.<br/><br/>Part of reality television&#39;s appeal is due to its ability to place ordinary people in extraordinary situations. For example, on the ABC show, The Bachelor, an eligible male dates a dozen women simultaneously, travelling on extraordinary dates to scenic locales. Reality television also has the potential to turn its participants into national celebrities, outwardly in talent and performance programs such as Pop Idol, though frequently Survivor and Big Brother participants also reach some degree of celebrity.<br/><br/>Some commentators have said that the name &quot;reality television&quot; is an inaccurate description for several styles of program included in the genre. In competition-based programs such as Big Brother and Survivor, and other special-living-environment shows like The Real World, the producers design the format of the show and control the day-to-day activities and the environment, creating a completely fabricated world in which the competition plays out. Producers specifically select the participants, and use carefully designed scenarios, challenges, events, and settings to encourage particular behaviours and conflicts.

The town is charming and worth exploring, with some fine examples of Khmer and French colonial architecture set among the more modern developments. Nowadays, visitors are flocking in, using it as a base for visits to the nearby temples.</p><h3>A Carved City</h3><p>From the 9th to the 14th centuries, when Europe was still struggling out of the Dark Ages, the Cambodian Empire of Angkor covered most of present-day Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand. The heart of this empire during the 12th century was the ancient capital of Angkor Thom, near present day Siem Reap, the site of the world&rsquo;s largest temple complexes, which were rediscovered in 1861.This spectacular city was built over 30 years under the reign of King Suryavarman II (1113-1150). The area covers about 400 square kilometres and is full of the finest examples of Khmer art and architecture. Tourists are always amazed at the scale of the place. </p><p>In Angkor Wat you will find more than 100 stone monuments and temple buildings, each of which contains countless statues, sculptures and reliefs that have weathered extremely little over the last 800 years. To see the whole thing can take several days. The most important temples to visit in the area are Angkor Wat, especially at sunrise or sunset; Angkor Thom, the remains of the capital; Ta Prohm, a palace overgrown by jungle; and Bayon.</p><h3>Getting a visa</h3><p>Visas are required to enter Cambodia. You can obtain one on arrival at Siem Reap International Airport for $20, and 1 passport photo is required per person. You will also need another passport photo for the Angkor Temple Entrance Pass. Please ensure you take comfortable walking shoes, light clothing and plenty of water to drink as it is very hot there. The most commonly accepted currency in Cambodia is the US dollar.</p>');

The murders three years later, by Tolai tribespeople on the Gazelle Peninsula, triggered angry reprisals. The English pastor who was head of the mission, George Brown, avenged the killings by taking part in an expedition that resulted in the deaths of a number of tribespeople and the burning of several villages.<br/><br/>Candles were lit in memory of the four. Fiji&#39;s High Commissioner in Papua New Guinea, Ratu Isoa Tikoca, accepted the apologies on behalf of the descendants.&quot;We at this juncture are deeply touched and wish you the greatest joy of forgiveness as we finally end this record disagreement,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>The Governor-General Sir Paulias Matane praised the early missionaries for making the country Christian and called for more people to follow the guiding principles of the religion.</p>');

Hindi is the national, official, and main link language of India. English is an associate official language. The Indian Constitution also officially approves twenty-two regional languages for official purposes.<br/><br/> Dozens of distinctly different regional languages are spoken in India, which share many characteristics such as grammatical structure and vocabulary. Apart from these languages, Hindi is used for communication in India. The homeland of Hindi is mainly in the north of India, but it is spoken and widely understood in all urban centers of India. In the southern states of India, where people speak many different languages that are not much related to Hindi, there is more resistance to Hindi, which has allowed English to remain a lingua franca to a greater degree.</p> <p><br/> Since the early 1600s, the English language has had a toehold on the Indian subcontinent, when the East India Company established settlements in Chennai, Kolkata, and Mumbai, formerly Madras, Calcutta, and Bombay respectively. The historical background of India is never far away from everyday usage of English. India has had a longer exposure to English than any other country which uses it as a second language, its distinctive words, idioms, grammar and rhetoric spreading gradually to affect all places, habits and culture.</p> <p><br/> In India, English serves two purposes. First, it provides a linguistic tool for the administrative cohesiveness of the country, causing people who speak different languages to become united. Secondly, it serves as a language of wider communication, including a large variety of different people covering a vast area. It overlaps with local languages in certain spheres of influence and in public domains.</p> <p><br/> Generally, English is used among Indians as a &lsquo;link&rsquo; language and it is the first language for many well-educated Indians. It is also the second language for many who speak more than one language in India. The English language is a tie that helps bind the many segments of our society together. Also, it is a linguistic bridge between the major countries of the world and India.</p> <p><br/> English has special national status in India. It has a special place in the parliament, judiciary, broadcasting, journalism, and in the education system. One can see a Hindi-speaking teacher giving their students instructions during an educational tour about where to meet and when their bus would leave, but all in English. It means that the language permeates daily life. It is unavoidable and is always expected, especially in the cities.</p> <p><br/> The importance of the ability to speak or write English has recently increased significantly because English has become the de facto standard. Learning English language has become popular for business, commerce and cultural reasons and especially for internet communications throughout the world. English is a language that has become a standard not because it has been approved by any &lsquo;standards&rsquo; organization but because it is widely used by many information and technology industries and recognized as being standard. The call centre phenomenon has stimulated a huge expansion of internet-related activity, establishing the future of India as a cyber-technological super-power. Modern communications, videos, journals and newspapers on the internet use English and have made &lsquo;knowing English&rsquo; indispensable.</p> <p><br/> The prevailing view seems to be that unless students learn English, they can only work in limited jobs. Those who do not have basic knowledge of English cannot obtain good quality jobs. They cannot communicate efficiently with others, and cannot have the benefit of India&rsquo;s rich social and cultural life. Men and women who cannot comprehend and interpret instructions in English, even if educated, are unemployable. They cannot help with their children&rsquo;s school homework everyday or decide their revenue options of the future.</p> <p>A positive attitude to English as a national language is essential to the integration of people into Indian society. There would appear to be virtually no disagreement in the community about the importance of English language skills. Using English you will become a citizen of the world almost naturally. English plays a dominant role in the media. It has been used as a medium for inter-state communication and broadcasting both before and since India&rsquo;s independence. India is, without a doubt, committed to English as a national language. The impact of English is not only continuing but increasing.</p>');

The pavements are stained with chewing gum that has been spat out and the gutters are full of discarded fast food cartons. Years ago I remember travelling abroad and being saddened by the plastic bags, discarded bottles and soiled nappies at the edge of every road. Nowadays, Britain seems to look at least as bad. What has <br/>gone wrong?</p><p> The problem is that the rubbish created by our increasingly mobile lives lasts a lot longer than before. If it is not cleared up and properly thrown away, it stays in the undergrowth for years; a semi-permanent reminder of what a tatty little country we have now.</p><p><br/>Firstly, it is estimated that 10 billion plastic bags have been given to shoppers. These will take anything from 100 to 1,000 years to rot. However, it is not as if there is no solution to this. A few years ago, the Irish government introduced a tax on non-recyclable carrier bags and in three months reduced their use by 90%. When he was a minister, Michael Meacher attempted to introduce a similar arrangement in Britain. The plastics industry protested, of course. However, they need not have bothered; the idea was killed before it could draw breath, leaving supermarkets free to give away plastic bags.</p><p><br/>What is clearly necessary right now is some sort of combined initiative, both individual and collective, before it is too late. The alternative is to continue sliding downhill until we have a country that looks like a vast municipal rubbish tip. We may well be at the tipping point. Yet we know that people respond to their environment. If things around them are clean and tidy, people behave cleanly and tidily. If they are surrounded by squalor, they behave squalidly. Now, much of Britain looks pretty squalid. What will it look like in five years? </p>');
